# Google Foobar

If you're seeing this repository, you're more than likely familiar with the elusive Google Foobar coding challenge.  
Like many others, I was invited at random while performing Python/coding related Google searches.  
Without fully understanding what I was getting involved in, I excitedly agreed and embarked on one of the most exciting journeys of my coding career!  

This repository contains the problems posed, as well as my approaches and solutions.  
My intent is to provide some useful documentation about the types of problems represented, and possible approaches to them.  
If you are invited to Google Foobar, you should make every effort not to copy code you find here, or elsewhere.  
Rather, you should focus on learning as much as you can, and attempt to implement your own solution to the best of your ability.  

When I participated in the challenge (Q3 2022, Foobar version 1-335-gea1c3e3-beta), Python solutions were accepted only in Python 2.7.13.  
As such, many things were implemented slightly differently than they could be now.  
I'm also not an expert by any stretch, so there is likely much room for improvement in both my understanding of and approach to many of these problems.
